# Image-Classification
Building a convolution neural network in Keras with python on a CIFAR-10 dataset. First, explore the dataset, and then train the neural network using python and Keras.
# Dataset
CIFAR-10 is used in this project. This dataset consists of 60,000 images divided into 10 target classes, with each category containing 6000 images and is readily available in dataset module of Keras.
